Enterprise-Grade URL Shortener Platform
Core Features:
* Custom short URLs (bit.ly/custom-name)
* QR code generation
* Click analytics and geolocation tracking
* Bulk URL processing
* API for developers
* URL expiration and password protection
Architecture:
Frontend: React dashboard for analytics Backend Services:
* URL Service (shortening/redirecting)
* Analytics Service (click tracking)
* User Management Service
* API Gateway Service
Databases:
* Redis for caching popular URLs
* RDS PostgreSQL for analytics data
* DynamoDB for URL mappings (high read/write)
AWS Infrastructure:
* Lambda - Serverless URL processing
* API Gateway - REST endpoints
* CloudFront - Global CDN for fast redirects
* S3 - QR code storage
* ElastiCache Redis - Hot URL caching
* Kinesis - Real-time click stream processing
DevOps Pipeline:
Jenkins:
* Automated testing (unit, integration, load testing)
* Blue-green deployments
* Performance benchmarking
Grafana Monitoring:
* Request latency dashboards
* Error rate tracking
* Geographic click distribution
* Popular domains analytics
Advanced Features to Showcase Skills:
* Rate limiting per user/IP
* Load testing with millions of URLs
* Auto-scaling based on traffic spikes
* Multi-region deployment for global performance
* Security features (malicious URL detection)
Why This Works:
* Simple concept, complex implementation
* Demonstrates scalability challenges
* Real performance metrics to monitor
* Can handle massive traffic simulation
